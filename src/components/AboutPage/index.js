                        Iâ€™m Ashleigh Cleghorn, welcome to my design portfolio. A portfolio usually showcases the projects or work of a designer. I believe that a portfolio should also showcase the person behind that work - interests, experiences, skills, and personality all combine to create a one-of-a-kind designer.
